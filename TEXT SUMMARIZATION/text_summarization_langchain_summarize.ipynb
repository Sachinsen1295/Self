This question reflects how the desire to live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuzama village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical connectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of products from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the transformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages are empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and with the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, primary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted in large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been developed into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products with support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co-operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen similar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PURA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agriculture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. We have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should empower the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green revolution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appointments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mind. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked God, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and help. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraja’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtrapati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the devastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the problem rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I have experienced many such acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction and rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even though there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothing like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few verses called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica.

In these three experiences, I personally felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man made. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regiments, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence Forces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night, Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counter any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defence Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in augmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Foundation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of students in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talked to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who related how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resource on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through value based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

This question reflects how the desire to live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuzama village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical connectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of products from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the transformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages are empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and with the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, primary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted in large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups.

This question reflects how the desire to live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the dream of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuzama village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical connectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of products from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the transformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages are empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and with the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, primary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted in large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been developed into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products with support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co-operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen similar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PURA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agriculture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. We have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should empower the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green revolution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appointments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mind. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked God, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and help. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraja’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtrapati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the devastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the problem rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I have experienced many such acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction and rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even though there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothing like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few verses called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the African Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected.

In these three experiences, I personally felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man made. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regiments, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence Forces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night, Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counter any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defence Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in augmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Foundation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of students in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talked to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who related how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resource on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through value based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.
