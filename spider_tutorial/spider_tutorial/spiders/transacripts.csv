Oh come on Bob,,we've both failed Richard,He doesn't want either of us now!,Just because you couldn't make it with him!,I'll take care of her, leave her to me,- Look, this isn't getting us anywhere,- She's pushing her luck!,Alright, so she's upset,about the girl, but if...,- You, uh... couldn't make it?,- What?,That's what you said,to Penelope, wasn't it?,- What couldn't she make?,- Richard,- Is that a guess or do you know?,- Know! Well... he told me,He was very depressed,,and... well, it all came out,And incidentally, I'm,not homosexual you know,- And there was nothing between Richard...,- No, no I understand,It goes much deeper than that,Richard never told you, or Penelope, but...,he's never made it with anyone,I refuse to continue this conversation,any further, will you please leave my room,Oh yes, I'm getting,through to you, aren't I?,I know what you wanted,from Richard... Prestige, status,,your face in the glossy magazines,""The honourable Lady Fountain entertains"",You do talk a lot of rubbish,I don't give a damn what you want,- What I want is to find Richard,- So do I,- Well will you stop fighting me?,- Are you going?,- No!,- Right. Then I am,Ice sweeties?,Help! Help! Help!,* Siren *,* Woman shouts in Greek *,... theory is that Richard believes that,Walter Goodrich caused his impotence,Ha ha,I can imagine that type of classic,resentment happening here,,in the theatre of Minas,So of those Minoan rites were, to,the say the very least of it, unsavoury,But you can hardly believe that,Minoan rites could take place in Oxford,Can you imagine a don,being castrated by the provost?,It's really metaphorical. You,see, the promise to Richard,is a symbol of the establishment,And to Richard, the,establishment destroys, castrates...,For example, Richard's marriage to Penelope,or Goodrich's continual,academic wheeling and dealing,- That's irrational,- According to Bob, Richard came to Greece,in search of some sort of freedom,Uh huh,- To seek his manhood,- Oh!,Well, they say that this climate,works wonders for that sort of thing,Maybe Bob's African background,has given him a sort of vivid imagination,- Do you think he was right?,- I'm not sure,- Hydra...,- Hydra?,I knew there was something...,A couple of years ago,there was a scandal... It,involved Johnny Katamandris,It was pretty bad...,I think that Richard left,this notebook for us to find,Yes, go on,He could have been taken to,Hydra, possibly against his will,Why Hydra?,Some ancient religious,cults... cruel, vicious,are rumoured to still,exist on the island now,despite denials by the,Greek Orthodox church,Wait a minute... Didn't,Hercules sack the city of Hydra,because of the vicious,behaviour of its inhabitants?,Yes... That's mythological,history, of course.,On the other hand, history does,have a way of repeating itself,* Policeman speaks Greek,,asks for Major Longbow *,Ego,* Policeman and Longbow speak Greek *,* Policeman speaks Greek *,This old woman's daughter was murdered,* Policeman speaks Greek,,mentions Richard Fountain *,What was that he was saying about Richard?,The police want to question him,,seeing as there were similar occurrences,in Corinth and Mykonos,when Richard was there,* Policeman speaks Greek *,The inspector wants to know,whether to charge the old woman,No, no charges. Can you let her go?,Okey dokey.,* Policemen speak Greek *,- Where are they taking her?,- To the hospital,She'll be well taken care of,* Policeman speaks Greek,,mentions Richard Fountain *,- Do we know where Richard is?,- No,We needed help if we,were to find Richard quickly,so we contacted Colonel,Stavros of the Greek intelligence,I can assure you, Colonel, that,we'll stick to our side of the bargain,Good! I'm sure Mr Fountain's father,,such a friend of Greece, would not wish him,involved on any scandal on Greek soil,We'll try and have Fountain,out of the country within 48 hours.,Excellent,Now we must go to the airport. I have,placed a helicopter at your disposal.,- Efharisto, Colonel,- Hm! You are very welcome,I have instructed the Mayor of,Hydra to give you every assistance,- Thank you very much Colonel. Goodbye!,- Goodbye,* Priest prays in Greek *,- Where did the mayor go?,- Next transport,All this red carpet treatment...,I'm beginning to think that Richard,is a reincarnation of Lord Byron,The authorities are,faced with a major problem,- Whatever Richard's been up to...,- Murder?,Don't be so dramatic,Penelope, there's no proof,However, obviously Richard's been,involved in some kind of scandal...,with a very important Greek,The Greek government are just as anxious,as we are to get Richard out of the country,I bet... Anything to save some Greek VIP,A habit which, I fear, is not the,exclusive province of the Greeks,Suppose it was murder?,* Woman singing *,* Boy speaks Greek *,I see... And where does that path lead to?,The monastery... Haematos Christou,If it was Richard he's sick,They've taken him to the,monastery of the blood of Christ,Well thank you very much,Yannis for your help and transport,Bye!,Not far now,Well don't you see, Tony? Hydra:,the hundred-headed monster,Each head, when it was cut off, grew again,by nature of some power,derived from its central body,A kind of infection,,guaranteeing immortality,- But that's mythology - But doesn't it,remind you of any cult or superstition?,It reminds me of all superstitions...,Christianity, for one,The Abbott says that in fact Chriseis,did bring him up here to be cured,but the monks have treated him,- Cured? What from?,- An ancient sickness,Go on.,Apparently, she doesn't want him,to be cured, merely to be kept alive,Now he says that he,thinks that she loves him,but that when she has no further,use for him she'll cast him off,* Abbott speaks Greek *,Then let him die,Now, what's he talking about?,Do you know what he means?,I think I do...,Centuries ago, the people of,Hydra brought this curse to the island,The monks tried to fight it,and in so doing found a cure for it,What form does this curse or sickness take?,It's... to do with the blood,Are you alright Penelope?,Yes, I think I'll just go for a walk,She looked a bit sick,,maybe I should go with her,No, stay where you are,* Abbott speaks Greek *,* Abbott speaks Greek *,No, I'll be alright, thank you,Yes... The Abbott says,they took this mountain pass,Where does it lead to?,To that old fort up there,A journey of about two, three hours,Two or three hours? It's only five,miles, we can use the Landrover,It's not passable, it's just a mule track,* Screams *,* Abbott speaks Greek *,What's that all about?,The monks' cells are normally,out of bounds to women,but in this case the Abbott,has given his permission,You didn't just leave him there did you?,- Leave who there?,- Richard,He was lying there... Dead,- Where?,- In the temple, out there,You come with me,- Look!,- What happened?,The monks make some great moonshine,You were suffering from wine,plus sunshine, nothing worse,You just take it easy now,- You don't have to go do you?,- I must. The Abbott will look after you,- Take me with you,- Now you rest,We'll be back as soon as,we can, and with Richard,Thank you,* Abbott speaks Greek *,* Chriseis whispers in Greek *,* Chriseis whispers in Greek *,Richard... Richard...,* Chriseis whispers in Greek *,* Chriseis shouts in Greek *,* A scream *,No!,Are you alright? Put this on,Tony! He's in a trance!,- They've taken the mules,- They've what!?,Bastards!,- We'd better carry him down,- In the dark?,- No we wait til dawn,- Could you take the two kids with you?,- Right,- Pick up Penelope at the monastery...,and get her off the island,And Richard?,I don't want Penelope to see him like this,Bob?,He's awake,I got your cable in... Mykonos,I wanted to stay til you came, but...,Chriseis's influence was too strong,I found myself... speaking in riddles,I was trying to cheat her...,or you,I don't know,It was a pretty crazy riddle,""Ariston men hydor"",Hydo... Hydra... You understood,It was Derek Longbow,A classical education still has its uses,- Where's Chriseis?,- She's gone,- Try to sleep,- You must watch for her,She'll be back,He's too weak to travel,He's too sick to be carried,down in this condition,I'll just have to pick up,any sort of transport I can get.,Wait,- Where are you going?,- Down to Hydra. To make some arrangements,- To get us out of here,- You can't go... Not yet,Anyone...,I must... protect you...,- Bob?,- Yes?,Take me outside...

Don't try,to hide anything Derek, how bad is he?,Well he's suffering from,some kind of hallucination,It would be better if he didn't,see you until he was in England,Now you go home, and say nothing,That won't be difficult,if you don't explain!,Oh I wish I knew what the hell was,happening. What am I going to tell father?,Absolutely nothing! Just tell,him that Richard was taken ill,,and Tony will explain it all later,Now bon voyage, have a good trip!,- Bye!,- Bye bye!,- I need your help,- Of course,* Speaks Greek *,- Athens,- Athens?,They don't trust us to,carry out their instructions.,Why?,They sent someone to interfere,- He is waiting for you there.,- Oh!,Colonel Stavros,What did you find?,Well, uh... it was some,kind of orgiastic ritual,- And Fountain?,- He wasn't involved,He was in a hypnotic trance,You expect us to accept that story?,In Corinth, Mykonos, Crete,,Fountain was merely an...,- ...an accessory after the fact,- Yes,Major, this is an order.

Ritualistic murder!,There's got to be a perfectly logical,explanation, not this mumbo jumbo!,Mumbo jumbo! I suppose,you don't believe in superstition?,No,- Never walked around,a ladder? - Never,Or thrown salt over your shoulder?,* Speaks Greek *,Alright... what's your explanation?,- Dependence,- What?,Dependence! Richard came,to Greece in search of freedom,The plan backfired, and he,became dependent on Chriseis,because she's the inheritress of,an ancient and obscene practice,Come on Bob! In this day and age?,Look, only a year back, a man,was sacrificed in a London park,You've got your witches' covens in Mayfair,,voodoo in Soho, how do you explain that?,Logic?! Science?!,* Groaning, screaming *,* Calling for help *,This way!,Must be Chriseis! Go back!,Give me your hand!,* Chriseis screams *,Derek! Find a foothold!,* Chriseis screams *,* Derek screams *,Bob...! Bob...! Bob!,- You've killed her,- It was an accident,We've got to get off the island,fast... Help me with Richard,She's not dead yet!,What the hell are you,trying to do you bloody fool!,It was an accident... What do,you want to do, make it murder?,Hours seemed to pass before,the helicopter arrived to pick us up,We had a difficult time convincing,the authorities in Athens with our story,but were finally allowed to,take Richard back to England,- Hello Tony!,- Oh hello Basil, how nice to see you,- Sad business,- Yes,- How did in happen?,- In Hydra,- Where's he buried?,- Athens,He'd have liked that. Derek was,fond of Greece. You know when I...,Basil, lovely to see you again, but I must,dash. Let's have dinner some time. - Yes,Richard!,- Where are you going?,- Oxford,- Take care,- Of course,The one man I knew who might,logically explain the events in Greece,was Professor Holmstrom,Well, vampirism is a phenomenon popularly,associated with central and eastern Europe,It is however, of course, universal,though happily extremely rare,The romantic aspects of vampirism we,know, of course, mainly through the movies,Count Dracula and,such... the immortal,bloodsucker with the,overdeveloped molars...,graves opening at,sunset as he goes forth on,his nightly prowl for,beautiful victims...,garlands of garlic to,prevent our heroine from,donating her blood to,an unworthy cause...,the dreaded holy cross, blinding,the eyes of our thirsty villain...,and finally, his gory demise,,as the stake pierces his heart,and sends his tormented,soul into another world,That's charming, isn't it?,Well, so much for the,legend of vampirism, Tony,Ha, hokum I call it,You can call it what you like. I,happen to have spent a whole lifetime,studying the origins of,man, you see, so I know,that there is a more,serious and scientific aspect,For instance, did you know that,vampirism is a sexual perversion?,Erik, this is no time for jokes,Sado-masochism, my dear man, is no joke,Now, sado-masochistic,perversions, as you know,,are more likely to appeal to,frigid females and impotent males,This, uh... friend of,yours, what's his name?,What's his sexual status?,Do you know, I really don't know,Ah... um. Well...,Example: the man is impotent,Oh, he's searching for fulfilment,He meets a girl,or, even a man I suppose,Let's skip the rather special cases,of the homosexual vampire shall we?,Alright, anybody, anybody, male or female,provided... they satisfy,his sexual appetites,Are you trying to tell me that...,a girl sucking blood from a man's neck...,- ... can induce an orgasm?,- Yes of course!,- Huh...! Erik!,- Oh no, come come Tony, don't be so naive,Man works and loves in many ways,Some men, for instance, get,excitement only from statues,The Pygmalion syndrome,Other men can only make love in a coffin,You have voyeurs, transvestites,,narcissists, bestialists...,Ah, it's a funny old world we live in,And, by the same token, you,also have masochistic vampires,Now, if this is the,case with your friend...,well, I must tell you,that there is a grave risk,The best advice I can give you is to,make sure that he's not reminded of it,I'll do that... I'm sure with,some rest he'll recover,Back at college Richard rested,then returned to his,sporting activities and studies,The shadow began to lift, and his life,seemed gradually to return to normality,Now, Richard, I hope you won't mind,my talking shop two weeks before term,- Even if I did it wouldn't,stop you! - Quite!,I've got rather a tight,schedule for you I'm afraid,First, there's your official welcome,back to college at the quincentenary dinner,Lovely party Walter!,- So very glad you could come,- Thank you,- I suppose I'll have to make a speech,- Or just something short and witty,Then I've arranged that course,of lectures for you at Manchester,In term, with all my other commitments?!,Good money, plus expenses.,Help your status, dear boy,And now for our other spot of business...,your engagement to Penelope,I shall make the announcement tonight,Aren't you rather taking,things for granted, sir?,I've hardly discussed,the matter with Penelope.,I have,She's thrilled!,Penelope darling, I'm so delighted!,To Penelope and Richard,,long life and happiness!,Cheers!,(God help them both),I'm not even in college this term!,I've been put into some lousy,boarding house on the Woodstock Road,Who arranged that?,Doctor Walter Goodrich... who else?,Bastard!,We're back to square one, Richard,Chriseis won't like that,Chriseis won't like that at all,Happy, darling?,- Yes, of course I am,- How do you feel?,Look...! I must finish this chapter tonight,I'm in the way...! oh, ... I'm sorry,- I'll see you tomorrow,- Alright my darling,Don't work too late,- Night, Richard,- Night,* Woman singing *,* Woman singing *,* Woman singing *,* Singing voices multiply *,Chriseis?,Chriseis?,Well that's what Marc Honeydew wrote me,That your father's been putting,the pressure on Richard again,- Marc Honeydew's an old woman!,- Let's stick to the point, shall we?,Daddy is not putting,the pressure on Richard,,he's arranging,things out of kindness,Then tell your father that,type of kindness can kill,Oh, stop being such a bloody,bully, Tony, I'm doing my best,Well it's just not good enough...,Hello? Hello...? Penelope?,Bob Kirby rang me and said it was,vital I come to Oxford immediately,There were signs that Richard,was beginning to crack again,Excuse me, have you seen Mr Kirby?,Mr Kirby!,Bob!,Geoff, will you excuse me a minute please?,Ok, Bob, what's all this,about? Are you sure?,Quite.,But that's impossible,,she just can't be...,Look I told you what we,should have done in Greece,but you wouldn't listen to me,- That is over,- Is it?,Alright! The point is, it,mustn't get any worse,- Let's get him out of Oxford,- It's Richard's speech tonight,- Speech? What speech?,- The quincentenary dinner,Do you remember at,the Vice Chancellor's,election, there was,the most frightful scene?,Charles Crabtree, that,most long-winded of orators,Oh, and talking of speeches, you will,keep yours brief, won't you dear boy?,Of course.,Well, Charles's bladder had,grown weak with the years...,And at the pay-off of some thirty,minute anecdote of total tedium,he suddenly flew from the high table,with his gown billowing out behind,him like Count Dracula's cloak,* Laughter *,Come along, Robert, time for din-dins,We mustn't keep dear Dr Goodrich waiting,In nomine beati Henrici,,sit felicitas vobiscum,Nobiscum et tecum et,cum spiritu beati Henrici,- You've dined in the hall before?,- Yes I have,Your Royal Highness...,your Excellency...,my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,It is my very great pleasure this evening,as provost of Lancaster,College in the University of Oxford,to welcome back to college our truly,beloved Magistri, Richard Fountain!,Redeuntis et acclamandi,My friends!,When a man comes back,from abroad, it is, as you,know, an ancient custom,that he brings a message,Mine is a message of freedom!,Let us beware of those who seek,to possess our bodies and our minds,for the academic world dehumanises us,and we become its natural dependents,""Love me!"" says the academic,,""and do exactly as I tell you"",In this protection racket,of the establishment,the outsiders are labelled,""them"", the collective enemy,the reds, the blacks, the,whites, the yellow peril...,We are brainwashed into the,same hatreds of the same threats,and over the years our,behaviour has become captive,and so in brotherhood we,plunge to our own destruction,But the gods!,The gods have given us freedom, my friends,Do not be trapped by the petty,schemes of academic hirelings,the thieves who come to take your souls,sitting among you now...,smooth deceivers...,in scarlet gowns, preparing as,soon as they rise from this table,to leech onto you!,Such a man is sitting there...,or there...,or there,or there,Worst of all - there!,Richard!,But that's not all, my friends,- Use your power... exercise your...,- Richard!,Enough, Richard! Enough!,Leave him alone, you've had your chance!,- Richard? Take it easy,- Don't touch me,Come on!,Quiet!,Keep quiet and sit down!,I command you!,Richard!,Through there!,- Where did they go?,- Come on!,* Woman singing *,Richard...,Richard...,Richard...,Make love to me...,Love me... love me Richard,Love me... kiss me...,make love to me Richard,Richard...,* She screams *,In there!,My God!,Richard!,God!,* Bird shrieks *,* Richard screams *,As provost of Lancaster College,in the University of Oxford...,I am empowered to act,as coroner, in respect of,death which occurred,within the college precincts,The privilege was granted,to all provosts of this college,by our founder, King Henry VI,and has been countenanced,by his royal successors,The inquest may take place in,private, without the presence of the press,the police, or any other outside authority,Only the verdict need be made public,It is my verdict...,that Penelope...,that Penelope Goodrich...,and Richard Fountain...,being misused by the,world, did in equal consent,take their own lives,the one by the letting of blood,the other by falling,from a college building,while temporarily of unsound mind,May God...,and our beloved founder...,have pity for their souls,Officially the matter was closed,but as Bob had realised, back in Greece,I now knew there was one,last act still to be carried out,I can't go through with it!,- We have to,- I can't!",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Incense_for_the_Damned-65887

here,Voices,Noises, shouts,Everything,Why recording?,I always remember the beautiful things,It will be useful,Often LSD causes amnesia,It could be either total or partial,Partial?,We could have only partial memories,of what happen tonight,Better to put away hazardous objects,and lock ourselves inside,Take it easy,one dose should be enough,One of us could do something stupid,perhaps...,diving into the sea,or climbing the flagpole,I want to take no chances,even if LSD causes insensitivity to pain,How do we get out of here tomorrow?,We'll break the door down,it's Nora's boat after all,Who's going

like that?,Do you know?,Perhaps...,you wanted to look like a black man,and seduce Carla,Don't be ridiculous,Do you remember who shot me instead?,Shot you?,Who shot who?,Are you joking?,Joking?,What is this then?,Luckily you shot me with a toy-gun,Are you sure you didn't do this yourself?,By myself, you say?,Is there a medical kit in here?,The bullet is still inside,Doesn't it hurt?,Not much for the moment,but soon the effect of the drugs will worn off,and I won't be this cheerful,It's better that I take this time,to go and wash this idiotic paint,I want to take this stupid mask off immediately,What are you staring at?,I'm starting to remember something,I have already seen you two on that bed,Sure, we were sleeping,No, you were wide awake,and I remember something clearly,You took Carla away from the living room,and she let you kiss and hug her,What are you saying?,You haven't brought her on this bed to sleep,Oh really?,Perhaps you even remember when,my vampire teeth came out,Come on now, let's wash your face,I'm dying,Relax now,My heart...,is not beating,It's just an impression,You will feel better soon,don't be afraid,Call my father, please,Daddy, daddy,Again with daddy,She keeps repeating the same thing,Who knows what we did,yesterday night,Something must have been recorded,perhaps, even who shot me,Wait,Nora and Carla have the right to know too,Has it started hurting?,Are you really sure,there was a gun in here?,What is that then?,Do you remember anything about this awesome night?,What do you care about what I remember?,Just curious,I want to know who shot me,Did you do bang-bang?,Shot you?,Oh, shut up!,What are you throwing away?,It's too late now,My stomach,Take her outside to throw up,Bust the door down then,No hard work for me,I've got a hole in my spleen,Nancy, do something,open the door,Believe me,I study medicine,But there's little blood coming out,There's a reason for that,The bullet acts like a cork,And if the cork pops off...,Puff!,Haemorrhage and amen,Are you not overdoing it?,Aren't you overreacting a little?,Why should I?,Let's go back,and bring me to Venice hospital,Hospital?,It's a pretty quick operation,The spleen can be removed,like tonsils or the appendix,I can easily live without it,Does it need to be done right away?,If I don't go flailing around,we have all the time to get to Venice,Okay,Nora needs a cold shower first,so she can snap out of it,She's the one driving us there,In the meantime,come and lay down in the cabin,How is Nora doing?,She puked her guts out,Is it...,Is it true that Marco has been shot?,Don't you worry,It's nothing serious,What did Marco do to me?,That dirty-minded man!,What do I know about it?,I'm not your maid, you know?,I'm sorry,Everything is still such a blur,Did you shoot him by any chance?,Who did I shoot?,Marco has been injured,Injured you say?,How?,There was a gun in here,Oh yes, in the drawer,A little one,My mother bought it,when she was acting all jealous,No...,I don't remember seeing it,Not tonight,But I do remember something vividly,Marco is running towards me,naked,and he's shouting,His body emanates a strong scent,even from afar,It's sweet and nauseous,Almost suffocating,Why don't we listen to the tape?,Knowing the truth,could turn us against each other,There's only one thing to do,to treat Marco's wound,without us feeling guilty for what has happened,Alright?,Nancy,Are you sure you can't remember,who shot him?,Sure I don't!,I could be lying though, not only for myself!,Maybe to protect one of you stupid girls!,When he is fine,When all of us will laugh about this,Only then, we will listen to the tape,and will know what has happened tonight,Do you agree?,Alright,How are you feeling now Nora?,Like shit,Hello?,Hello?!,Why
